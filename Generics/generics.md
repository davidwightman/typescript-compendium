# Generics

Union types when you are flexible with every method or function call

Generic types are good when you want to lock in a specific type
Good in cases where you have a type that actually works together with multiple other possible types (e.g. an object which emits data of different types). Generics help you create data structures that work together or wrap values of a broad variety of types (e.g. an array that can hold any type of data)

Constraints allow you to narrow down the concrete types that may be used in a generic function.
